          <h3>Benefits of drumming</h3>

          </div>
          <h4>Drumming can change the way you think.</h4>
          <p>There is something primeval about drumming. It’s cross cultural. It has moved people to battle, to joy, to healing, to purpose across history. It gets endorphins flowing, thought processes smooth out and patterns are more readily perceived. It increases pain tolerance and learning ability.</p>

          <p>Even when done in a group setting, such as a corporate event, it changes the way each person’s mind works on an individual basis.</p>

          <p>Well known neuroscientists like David Eagleman are proving that it is directly linked to intelligence and problem solving skills. Researchers at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm came to a very similar conclusion and yet another researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch proved its efficacy in treating kids with ADD with the impressive side effect of making lasting improvements to their IQ scores.</p>

          <p>Research done by Annette Schirmer of the Department of Psychology at the National University of Singapore has found further correlations between rhythm and the manner, and perhaps even efficacy, with which we are able to perceive and process our surroundings: “Something seen at a point precisely in beat with an auditory rhythm is more likely to be perceived than if it appears out of synch with the rhythm.” (Scientific American R. Douglas Fields).</p>

          <p>Rhythm has been cited by some as an important part of the human evolutionary process. More companies are now realizing that it’s time to bring drumming back to our corporate events and team building activities.</p>

          <h3>History about Drums</h3>

          <p><b>Ah, the drums – one of the world’s oldest instruments and still one of the favourites today. They come in lots of different shapes and sizes and make a variety of sounds. Here are some interesting drum facts that you might not know:</b></p>

        <h4>From the Beginning</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/adult-artist-band-804552.jpg" alt="a amn playing drum inside mall"><figcaption>Photograph: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@gesel" target="_blank">Genaro Servín</a></figcaption>

        <p>Drums were with us from the dawn of mankind, making them one of the oldest musical instruments in the world. Originally, they were natural objects that could be hit, but real drums were later developed with membranes made of animal skin. The oldest drum to be discovered is the Alligator Drum, which is said to have manifested shamanistic characteristics and was often used in ritual ceremonies. The earliest record of it is from 2300BC – 1900BC.</p>

        <h4>Great Exercise</h4>
        <p>Drumming Is known to be one of the best forms of exercise as it burns more calories in a half hour session than cycling, weight lifting, and hiking. In fact, it has even been adapted into an actual workout called Drums Alive which involves aerobic dancing and jamming on exercise balls. Recreational drum playing is also lowers the amount of stress hormones in our body.</p>

        <h4>The Drums as We Know Them</h4>
        <p>The modern drum kit was formed during the 1930s – before that, musical bands used more than one person to control the drums in orchestras. The average drum kit has 5 pieces – the bass drum, snare drum, two toms, and a floor tom, as well as several cymbals; crash, hi-hat, and ride. The world’s largest drum kit has 813 pieces and took 36 years to build. It was created by Dr. Mark Temperato who is working on expanding it to 1000 pieces!</p>

        <h4>The First Step</h4>
        <p>The Ludwig Drum Company, a popular American drum manufacturer, became known for its first product back in 1909 – the first ever workable bass drum foot pedal system, which paved the way for what was eventually to become the modern drum set as we know it.</p>

        <h4>The Electric Drums</h4>
        <p>The first electronic drum was created by Graeme Edge, drummer of The Moody Blues, back in the early 1970s. They became widely popular in the 80s, and people even thought that they would phase out the traditional drums. It turns out, however, that drummers still preferred to play acoustic kits over electric ones.</p>
        <p>The drums are the most crucial part of the rhythm section in any band, and they require plenty of skills including limb independence, hand-eye coordination, and a good sense of rhythm.</p>
